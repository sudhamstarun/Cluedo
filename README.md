#### Kickstart ####

  ```
1. Run executable file from your project root directory

  ```bash
  $ sh bin/setup.sh
  ```
2. Run tools file from your project root directory to install testing tools globally
  ```bash
  $ sh bin/tools.sh
  ```
3. To start the application run npm start
  ```
  npm start
  ```

This should only be for development purpose. Original app should be on Heroku or some other hosting site. Will figure this out later.


#### Credits ####

This repo is a fork of the original author's existing repostiory (link). I am simply updating the UI a little and also the board used in the game to be more reflective of the actual board used to mimic the the real life effect. All credit for the effort involved in the logic of the game goes to the original author.
